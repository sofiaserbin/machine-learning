# Machine-learning

This is my work based on the course Machine Learning A-Z: AI, Python & R + ChatGPT Prize [2024]
from Kirill Eremenko and Hadelin de Ponteves. In this repository I will put learned theory and concepts into practice both using Python and R. 
Data files are provided in the course.
